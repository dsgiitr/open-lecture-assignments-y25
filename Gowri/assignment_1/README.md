# Conversion of .jpeg, .png to .jpg

#### Multiple government and exam application sites require image uploading, specifically in .jpg file format. Mutiple free file format conversion sites on the internet have a limit on the number of file conversion allowed at a time. To ease the conversion process I've written an elementary Bash script to perfom the conversion.

#### I've demonstrated the same in a temporary directory on a few image files. sed command is used to remove Windows-style carriage  return characters (\r) from the script file before running.
