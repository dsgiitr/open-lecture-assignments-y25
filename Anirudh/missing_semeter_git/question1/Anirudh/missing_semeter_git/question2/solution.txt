task is to remove a sensitive file from git history

1. Created a test repo with git init
2. Added a file secret.txt with sensitive data
3. Committed it by mistake
4. Used git filter-repo to completely remove it from history:
   Command:
   git filter-repo --path secret.txt --invert-paths
5 again had to use it by force 
  Command:
  git filter-repo --path secret.txt --invert-paths --force

  
6. Verified using:
   git log --all -- secret.txt
