analysed the important and useful git commands 

1. git init
   - Initializes the .git directory 
2. git add file.txt
   - Git creates a blob for the file content.
   - It also updates the index (staging area) which builds a tree structure for the next commit.
3. git commit -m "First commit"
   - Git takes the tree from the index and creates a commit object that points to it.
   - This commit has a unique SHA, an author, and points to the previous commit (if any).
4. git branch feature
   - Git creates a new pointer (ref) to the current commit.
5. git checkout <branch>
   - Moves the HEAD to the  branch. HEAD now points to that branch, which points to a commit.
6. git merge main
   - Combines trees from both branches and creates a merge commit with two parents.
